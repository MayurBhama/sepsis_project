# Sepsis Prediction — End-to-End MLOps Project
Status: Under Maintenance (Major Model Upgrade in Progress)
(All pipelines, APIs, and dashboards are functional. Model upgrade phase ongoing.)
## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end MLOps project built to predict Sepsis in ICU patients using machine-learning and modern DevOps tools.

The project covers every real-world ML system component:

✔ Data ingestion (MongoDB)
✔ Data validation
✔ Pre-processing & feature engineering
✔ Train/validation/test split
✔ Hyperparameter tuning (Optuna)
✔ MLflow experiment tracking
✔ Production-ready FastAPI inference service
✔ Streamlit dashboard for monitoring
✔ MongoDB logging of predictions
✔ Full CI-ready folder structure
✔ Git-ready project with .gitignore
✔ Modular and scalable codebase

Goal: Build a real, industry-grade ML system for clinical risk prediction.

Note: The current model (XGBoost) shows low real-world performance due to the high noise & imbalance in the sepsis dataset.
A new ML pipeline on a better medical dataset is being prepared.
This repository is actively maintained.
